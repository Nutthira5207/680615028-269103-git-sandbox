## Instructions

* Fork this repo (original repo) to your GitHub account.
* Clone the forked repo to your local machine.
* On your local machine:
  * Create a new branch using `git checkout -b YOUR_STUDENT_ID` (replace YOUR_STUDENT_ID with your actual student ID).
  * Answer the questions below by editing this `README.md` file. You may refer to course materials but may NOT copy from other students.
  * After answering all questions, commit your changes.
  * Run the command `git log --oneline > YOUR_STUDENT_ID.log` to save your commit history to a file named with your student ID.
  * Add this log file to Git and commit this addition to your branch.
  * Switch to main branch using `git checkout main`, then merge your branch using `git merge YOUR_STUDENT_ID`. Do NOT delete your branch after merging.
  * Push all changes to your remote repo on GitHub.
* On GitHub:
  * Create a pull request (PR) to the original repo
  * Use **YOUR_STUDENT_ID** as the PR title
  * Submit by **Friday Febuary 27, 2024 1:00pm (GMT+7)**.
  * Leave the PR open after submission.
* Your PR must include the following:

**Answer:** 
1. ls

Function:
The ls command lists files and directories in the current directory or in a specified path.

Why it is essential for new engineers:
This command helps engineers understand the project structure and quickly check what files are available. It is one of the most basic and frequently used commands when working in a Linux environment.

2. grep

Function:
The grep command searches for specific text or patterns inside files or command outputs.

Why it is essential for new engineers:
It allows engineers to quickly find important information, such as errors in log files or specific code snippets in large projects. This improves efficiency and saves time when debugging or analyzing data.

2. After one and a half years in the ISNE program, what advice would you give to prospective ISNE students? (Minimum 50 words)

**Answer:** 
After studying in the ISNE program for one and a half years, the advice I would like to give to students who are interested in this program is to be well prepared in managing your time and to stay consistent with your studies. The courses can be quite challenging, so reviewing the lessons regularly is very important.

Do not hesitate to ask questions when you do not understand something, and try to practice your practical skills as much as possible. Most importantly, maintain your curiosity and motivation to learn, because the effort you put in will greatly affect your grades and your future career goals.
